                    <p class="brand-history"><strong>A brand with heritage and evolution.</strong></p>
                    <p>Originally launched in 2011 as our flagship retail offering, Raja Rani transitioned to wholesale
                        in 2014 to power our B2B expansion. This decade of wholesale mastery has allowed us to perfect
                        our sourcing and processing standards.</p>
                    <p>As of 2025, we are reintroducing this legacy brand to the retail market. Backed by 15 years of
                        consumer trust and comprehensive marketing support, we are combining heritage with a fresh focus
                        on the modern kitchen.</p>
